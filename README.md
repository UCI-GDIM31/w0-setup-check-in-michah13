# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Michael Hernandez, I go by they/them. I like to play a good variety of games, but my most time is probably spent in fighting games. I'm taking this class because game design is a career I'm interested in pursuing after I graduate. I have had some experience with game development, and I honestly just hope to build any game in general.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [Y] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping to leave this class feeling like I learned something. To be more specfic, though, I would want to be able to make a game I am proud enough of to show other people.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm nervous about the fact that I've never done programming on a scale this large.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

I am familiar with JavaScript and Python.

2. Game development (any engine)

I developed a game as a part of a group on JavaScript, somehow.

3. Unity

N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

N/A

2. Scope management

N/A

3. Iteration

N/A

4. Object-Oriented programming

I do know what object-oriented programming is because my game was object-oriented, but I don't know how to put it into words. It's programming where everything is grouped into categories, for example, in my game, gameplay was done on a grid, and every bit of the enviroment - like floors, cannons, moving platforms - were all different incarnations of the "block" object.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

N/A
